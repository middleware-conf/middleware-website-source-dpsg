The MIDDLEWARE Steering and Organizing Committees have been actively discussing how the situation surrounding COVID-19 has been evolving around the world. 

We deeply sympathize with those who have been affected in various ways by COVID-19. Our primary concern is that members of our community, and their families and friends, remain safe and healthy. We are aware of the challenges people in different regions of the world are facing, and consequently MIDDLEWARE 2020 was a virtual conference.

After considering various factors, MIDDLEWARE 2021 was also fully virtual.

MIDDLEWARE 2022 in Quebec City, Canada was held in-person after governmental restrictions on gatherings were lifted. We anticipate that MIDDLEWARE 2023 and 2024 will be held in-person..
